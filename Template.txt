Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Account Manager, RAC position at Rumble. With obtaining a Bachelor's degree and currently pursuing my Master's in Applied Data Science from New College of Florida, combined with hands-on experience in data analysis, marketing, and project management, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. My background in data analysis

In my previous roles, I have demonstrated a strong ability to build and manage client relationships, develop innovative digital campaigns, and deliver measurable ROI. For example, during my time as a Data Analyst Marketing Intern at Four Winds IT, I built automations that streamlined customer assignments and created comprehensive Power BI reports to provide clients with critical data insights. Similarly, my experience as a Graduate Research Assistant involved converting reports from Tableau to Power BI and building dashboards for public use, showcasing my technical expertise and ability to manage complex projects.

I am particularly drawn to Rumble's mission to create a free and open Internet and its commitment to providing a neutral platform immune to cancel culture. I share Rumble's passion for challenging the status quo and am eager to contribute to its success by driving innovative, insight-driven digital campaigns within the Rumble Advertising Center. My technical skills, including proficiency in Python, R, SQL, and various data visualization tools, will enable me to dive deep into campaign performance data, optimize campaigns, and provide strategic recommendations to enhance client performance.

Moreover, my strong presentation and communication skills, combined with my attention to detail and ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams, make me a perfect fit for this role. I am confident in my ability to educate clients and their agencies on Rumble's ad products, drive platform adoption and engagement, and provide ongoing technical support and real-time analysis.

I am excited about the opportunity to join Rumble and contribute to the success of the video creator community. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with Rumble's goals.

Sincerely,

Raymond Bidini
