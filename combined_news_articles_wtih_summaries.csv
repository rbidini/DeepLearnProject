Broadcom's Software Expansion And AI Potential Drive Stock ... - Forbes,"[+] by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) this week hit a new record high of $1,284 as investors applaud the chipmaker’s more diversified revenue stream following the recently completed $61-billion acquisition of cloud-software giant VMware and eye new growth opportunities in AI.
Going forward, there will be a greater emphasis placed on higher-margin infrastructure software. The company is forecasting that networking growth in the current fiscal year will accelerate nicely to 30%, driven by the increasing deployment of network connectivity and an expansion of AI accelerator demand from hyperscalers.
 In the October quarter, networking revenue rose 23% to $3.1 billion, with growth primarily driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators as well as networking switches, routers and network interfaces dedicated to scaling AI datacenters. For example, Truist recently raised its Broadcom target to $1,240 from $1,015 based on a positive view of the VMware business and the company’s “newfound AI exposure.”
 The firm is bullish on Broadcom’s AI-related businesses, optimistic about a cyclical recovery in the company’s classic semiconductor business and believes VMware synergies can drive operating margin expansion and earnings growth."
